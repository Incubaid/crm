- use as much as possible the tools (lots of autogeneration possible)
- keep everything as simple as possible
- the UID is always the 4 char generated code (lower case number/letter e.g. 5bhs), check dublicates, generate otherone if duplicate
- hosted behind caddy (can do the IYO integration & pass the info)
