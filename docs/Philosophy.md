## Philopsophy

- we are doing our ITO = Internal Token Offering we need tools to manage the users/tasks/projects asap
- we want to implement teal organization, didn't find right other tools to do this

## why not use existing tool

- i've already looked at so many
  - they are or too complex or too expensive, or not what we need or too ugly
  - they are not easy enough, too many fields, ...
- we want integration with GIT, too difficult to implement with other tools
- we want IYO integration
- too difficult to get teal features in

## 2ndary reasons

- these tools can be modified & offered on our future network of nodes, I am sure many people will like these kind of simple apps
